          This live show aims at providing an eminent platform to young achievers to express and share about their accomplishments, skills acquired, during the lockdown period. It will last for 2 days .  We believe such events encourage entrepreneurial mindset amongst students.

       <!-- <p class="Gotham font_size_30 "><br/>Problem Statement<br> <span class="font_size_15 Lato"><br/>
       
        <b>Information management system for JEC. </b><br/><br/>
        Our college has a vibrant culture, however it lacks balance and consistency. All kinds of information get circulated via a variety of platforms. However there is a problem associated with almost all the platforms. Emails are checked irregularly by a lot of students causing them to miss out on opportunities, platforms like whatsapp and telegram relay messages for all so students might miss out on important information if they do not check it thinking that it is not directed to them. This leads to a situation where some important information gets ignored by students or even gets mixed up sometimes. <br/>
        <br/><b>Create a website or app and the presentation of it and if you can't make the website and app then just create the presentation.</b><br/><br/>
        Problems to be tackled :<br/>
        1.Find out how the correct info can reach to relevant levels through some online medium. <br/> 

2.Unnecessary information shouldn't be directed to students.<br/> 

3.Students must get all the information they might need official or unofficial.<br/> 

4.Inauthentic information must be avoided.<br/> 
 
All these needs must be satisfied.<br/> 
Is a common in-out portal possible for official and non official information both? Share your solution and ideas in form of a ppt file supporting your app or website plan. This ppt will go along with your presentation later. 
<br/> 
Plagiarism is strictly prohibited!<br/>
